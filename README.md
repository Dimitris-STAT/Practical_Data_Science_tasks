# Practical_Data_Science_tasks

This repo is a collection of 3 projects implemented on the scope of the Practical Data Science course.

### Contents:

1. [Regular Expressions Scraping and Language Detection Project](). This project involves regular expressions scraping, language detection using regular expressions, and various related operations such as toxicity classification. The primary objectives include creating a language detector using regular expressions and performing additional tasks based on the detected language.
2. [A comparison of human vs chatGPT clustering on Greek proverbs](). This project contains a human-based clustering and analysis of the clustering done by master's students on a series of Greek proverbs. Additionally, a similar analysis is performed on clusterings generated by GPT models on the same proverbs, following instructions given to the model. Finally, a comparison between Humans and GPT is performed to identify interesting results and patterns.
3. [LLM generated Text Detection](). This project focuses on detecting whether an essay is written by a middle or high school student or generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). The dataset consists of both student-written and LLM-generated essays. The goal is to build a robust text classifier using various data augmentation and evaluation techniques.
